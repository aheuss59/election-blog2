This is my first blog post, for the week of September 2nd. The primary method of prediction for this week is a model based on the results of the past two presidential elections, 2016 and 2020. 





Table: <span id="tab:unnamed-chunk-1"></span>Table 1: Presidential races won by each party since 1948

|Party      | Races Won|
|:----------|---------:|
|Democrat   |        11|
|Republican |         8|
One thing I take away from this chart is how little data we actually have to train prediction models on. There have only been 19 presidential elections since 1948.
