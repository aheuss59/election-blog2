## Historic Accuracy of Polls

Poll averages seem like an intuitive way to predict elections - intuitively, if I walk around and ask everyone who they are going to vote for, I should get a pretty good idea of how many people are voting for each candidate. However, historically, polls become more accurate as the election approaches, often converging near the correct value within a week or so of the election. Several theories attempt to explain this, including the "enlightened blah blah" theory expressed by so and so in their book *book*.

[insert a graph of this if possible (picturing a scatterplot with weeks_left on the bottom and difference between poll and actual on the y)]






```
## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'
```
