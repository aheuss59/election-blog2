      <description>This is my first blog post, for the week of September 2nd. The primary method of prediction for this week is a model based on the results of the past two presidential elections, 2016 and 2020.&#xA;Table: Table 1: Presidential races won by each party since 1948&#xA;Party Races Won Democrat 11 Republican 8 One thing I take away from this chart is how little data we actually have to train prediction models on.</description>
