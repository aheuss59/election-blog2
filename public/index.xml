      <description>The Influence of the Economy on Elections [Discussion of the predictive power of the fundamentals and the economy - could mention the bread and peace model]. Especially talk about Q2 econ power.&#xA;## Warning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.&#xD;## â„¹ Please use `linewidth` instead.&#xD;## This warning is displayed once every 8 hours.&#xD;## Call `lifecycle::last_lifecycle_warnings()` to see where this warning was&#xD;## generated.&#xD;We can see that the correlations between Q2 GDP growth and the incumbent party&#39;s popular vote share are very different depending on whether or not 2020 is included.</description>

      <description>General Exploration and Popular Vote Over Time This is my first blog post, for the week of September 2nd. The primary method of prediction for this week is a simple model based on the results of the past two presidential elections, 2016 and 2020.&#xA;In considering the data to begin with, it is interesting, though not particularly informative to take a look at how many elections each party has won in elections since the end of WWII.</description>

      <description>XMin is the first Hugo theme I have designed. The original reason that I wrote it was I needed a minimal example of Hugo themes when I was writing the blogdown book. Basically I wanted a simple theme that supports a navigation menu, a home page, other single pages, lists of pages, blog posts, categories, tags, and RSS. That is all. Nothing fancy. In terms of CSS and JavaScript, I really want to keep them minimal.</description>
