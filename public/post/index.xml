      <description>This week, we discussed incumbency, federal spending and expert opinions as they relate to election forecasting.&#xA;How does incumbency influence presidential races? The question of how incumbency will play into the 2024 election is a complicated one. Historically, the advantage or disadvantage of running as a presidential candidate for the incumbent party, but not the incumbent president has been rather unclear. To narrow in on Harris&amp;rsquo; situation a little further, the graph below shows the elections where a member of the incumbent administration has run for president, but not the incumbent themselves.</description>

      <description>Historic Accuracy of Polls Poll averages seem like an intuitive way to predict elections - if I walk around and ask everyone who they are going to vote for, I should get a pretty good idea of how many people are voting for each candidate. Polls are a valuable prediction tool for election forecasts. However, not all weeks of polling are the same. Historically, polls become more accurate as the election approaches, often converging near the correct value within a week or so of the election.</description>

      <description>The Influence of the Economy on Elections The economy has long been thought a fundamental predictor of election outcomes. The basic premise is: when the economy is doing well, incumbent vote share is higher and vice-versa. In the book Democracy for Realists, Larry Bartels and Christopher Achen describe this theory at length and the predictive power of economic conditions in the months leading up the election. My second blog post explores the predictive power of economic conditions on incumbent party vote share, especially quarter 2 (Q2) GDP growth.</description>

      <description>General Exploration and Popular Vote Over Time This is my first blog post, for the week of September 2nd. The primary method of prediction for this week is a simple model based on the results of the past two presidential elections, 2016 and 2020.&#xA;In considering the data to begin with, it is interesting, though not particularly informative to take a look at how many elections each party has won in elections since the end of WWII.</description>
